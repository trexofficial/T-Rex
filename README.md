# T-Rex NVIDIA GPU miner
Overview
T-Rex is a versatile cryptocurrency mining software. It supports a variety of algorithms and we, as developers, are trying to do our best to make it as fast and as convenient to use as possible.

Developer fee is 1% (3% for Tensority).

Watchdog
Watchdog is intended to observe miner state and restart T-Rex if it crashes or hangs for any reason. Also, watchdog can optionally perform auto updates if a newer version is available. We recommend using the watchdog to avoid any downtime in mining and make sure your GPUs are busy 24/7. If you do need to disable the watchdog, you can do so using --no-watchdog parameter.
